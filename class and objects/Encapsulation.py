Discription:
------------
The wrapping up of data and functions into a single unit (called class) is known as encapsulation. 
Data encapsulation is the most striking feature of a class. The data is not accessible to the outside 
world, and only those functions, which are wrapped in the class, can access it. These functions provide 
the interface between the objectâ€™s data and the program. This insulation of the data from direct access 
by the program is called data hiding or information hiding.
