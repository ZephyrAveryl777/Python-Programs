#Python Program to find the sum of series: 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + â€¦.. + 1/N.
""""Problem Solution
1. Take in the number of terms to find the sum of the series for.
2. Initialize the sum variable to 0.
3. Use a for loop ranging from 1 to the number and find the sum of the series.
4. Print the sum of the series after rounding it off to two decimal places.
5. Exit.
