#This is a Python Program to find the sum of series: 1 + x^2/2 + x^3/3 + â€¦ x^n/n.
"""Problem Solution
1. Take in the number of terms to find the sum of the series for.
2. Initialize the sum variable to 0.
3. Use a for loop ranging from 1 to the number and find the sum of the series.
4. Print the sum of the series after rounding it off to two decimal places.
5. Exit.
